Okay guys, let's get this straight.  You just convinced our 24/7 server host to take a leave of absence.  You're pretty fucking stupid, let's put it that way.<br>
<br>
This is my server.  I'm not going to be nice.  If you're a GOOD Roleplayer, you have nothing to fear, and we want you here.  If not, then chances are in the near future you may be encouraged to either improve the quality of your roleplaying or consider playing on another SS13 server.<br>

There are no posted rules.  Common sense applies, and what the administration team says is law.<br>

<h3>Please note that this is a development server, not a 24/7 stable host.  Games may end on a whim, or as the developers need them to</h3>

<h3>RPing an insane guy isn't funny.  Using traitor items when you aren't the traitor and don't have a good in-RP reason to (trial evidence, inspection) is banworthy from now on.</h3>
